# [Basic Engineering](index.html)
--------------
Hi there! Welcome to my page on the basics of engineering, my way.
This is my blog/project page/design ideas or whatever word of the day you feel is appropriate. You can follow me as I learn the basics of things.
Hopefully along the way I can make easily digestable material for you to learn along with. Or join in the tomfoolery.

## FAQ
>Why not call it Basics of ECE?

Well it really is four broad umbrellas: Engineering Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering & Computer Science. Which is far too wordy for a title.

>Why do this?

I always wanted to start a blog about learning. I also like to teach. I never said I'm very good at it, but I'd like it.

>Who are you, or why should we trust you?

Like I said earlier, I am in no way saying I'm an expert in anything. I'm a student, and not a really intelligent one nor really that hardworking. This is actually to your benefit. I am not some great engineer who can postulate for hours on a particular design. *I AM* however a pretty basic person, and so my philosphy is if I can do it, then really anyone can. At least that's my hope.

>This site's design if fairly bland. Is that on purpose?

It's part my laziness and part [taking inspiration from this](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html).
This however is content focused and as such I've had prior success in using Markdown.
There are no frills, just content with a focused site like this. It is responsive. It is simple to design. It is not excessive.
If I had to make some kind of fizzywhosiewhatsit type of site for every single page, this would never get off the ground.
The focus would shift away from teaching and more on design.

Now with that out of the way, let's continue.

## [Blog](bindex.html)
I'll hope to blog about the entire experience as I go through it. We shall see how feasible that is.


## Topics (when I finally organize things)

---

### Prelude

---

Before we can start our adventures in EE, we need to uhh... make sure we know the math and stuff. Also the software. So let's get to it.

### Software
- CAS
- Verilog
- Python
  - Data Science
  - SageMath
  - Software Development
  - Ansible
- DevOPS
- C
- SystemC

### [Math](math.html)
Man oh man am I bad at math... It's almost laughable.  This is mostly review for what I'd like to do.


- Differential Equations
- System of Differential Equations

(My lame excuse for Lin Alg. Hey! Don't laugh, I still remember gramschmidth I think...Also rank, nullitly and spaces. Maybe.)

- Partial Differential Equation

(When I took this class all I got out of it was some hoo hah about system classifications, boundary conditions and have a fourier series? Will Travel. So I've got a lot to learn)

- Vector Calculus

(why didn't I just take this after MultiV Calc I'll never know. I've since *patched* my knowledge in my EMAG classes but there is something to be said about formal study. It sucks.)

- Numerical Methods

(Apparently knowing more than the trapezoid rule is almost required. Or just Runge Kutta, who'da thought right?)

- Common Integral Transformations

(A little bit of Laplace here a pinch of Fourier there)

- Discrete Time
(I hope to catch some Zs here. You know what they say right? Zs get degrees)

- A small word on control theory....

(You know, knowing about PID/LeadLag is probably not enough. I guess LQR, Kalman filters and robustness are necessary)

- Probability, probably
- Statistics is a possible likelyhood.

No seriously I am bad at math. I have not put in nearly enough time for practice, since I guess I'm pretty slow or bad at it.

 I didn't know how to pronounce Dirichlet so I called it Derelict boundary condition.
**I am dead serious**. [My friend looked at me like he'd seen someone not fit for this world](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/022/508/C7S0ouqVAAANACj.jpg). He has since then corrected me.
But not before I said this multiple times to my PDE and EMAG professors. Both with the same incredulous look on their face. I think I know why now.

By the by, [this is how you pronounce Dirichlet](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dirichlet?s=t).

Additionally I only intend to stick to circuits examples. Did you think I was going to derive some State Space representation or *do a proof*? **GASP**. How dare you dear reader.
See my biggest gripe with certain classes, let's take PDE's as an example, is I never got to see circuits applications until I took EMAG. So guess what? I'll be doing [EMAG Problems](http://unlcms.unl.edu/cas/physics/tsymbal/teaching/EM-913/section2-Electrostatics.pdf).
I really love EMAG even if I'm not that good at it. It's so awesome to see something physically happening in nature and then modelling it! Similarly for ODEs, plenty of examples of transient analysis with simple RLC circuits. Eat your heart out car acceleration problems.
