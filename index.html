# [Basic Engineering](index.html) 
--------------
Hi there! Welcome to my page on the basics of engineering, my way. 
Here I attempt to teach you about this fascinating world. 
I try to aim to satisfy all learning styles, so there will be content in both a video and 
on a the webpage such as this.

## FAQ
>What do you intend to teach? 

I plan to cover topics primarily related to Electrical and Computer Engineering.

>Why not call it Basics of ECE? 

Well it really is four broad umbrellas: Engineering Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering & Computer Science. Which is far too wordy for a title. 

>Why do this? 

I like to teach. I never said I'm very good at it, but I'd like it. 

>Who are you, or why should we trust you? 

Like I said earlier, I am in no way saying I'm an expert in anything. I'm a student, and not a really intelligent one nor really that hardworking. This is actually to your benefit. I am not some great engineer who can postulate for hours on a particular design. *I AM* however a pretty basic person, and so my philosphy is if I can do it, then really anyone can. At least that's my hope. 

>This site's design if fairly bland. Is that on purpose? 

It's part my laziness and part [taking inspiration from this](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html). My primary site is actually design focused. 
This however is content focused and as such I've had prior success in using Markdown. 
There are no frills, just content with a focused site like this. It is responsive. It is simple to design. It is not excessive. 
If I had to make some kind of fizzywhosiewhatsit type of site for every single page, this would never get off the ground. 
The focus would shift away from teaching and more on design. 

Now with that out of the way, let's continue.
