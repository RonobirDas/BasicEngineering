##Project Inspiration
---


It would seem that even in all my years of searching for content
on the web I have missed a pretty crucical and important site.
This site is EXACTLY what I'm looking to do, or in this case, Redo with RISC-V.

In addition I'll put up a bunch more cool sites.

The first and most important is project Oberon. My god this is amazing.

The whole point of this endevor is two fold, one to do it to learn about the basic
underlying systems, and then follow up with actual commerical software like Linux (using CLFS) or
implementing LLVM support with CPU0.

- [Project Oberon](http://www.projectoberon.com/)
- [Free Ebook Foundation](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md)

I'd like to eventually do the same thing with EE books or at least contribute to a project like that.
