## Do the (feature) creep....
I've got a lot of stuff planned to do, but it's really overwhelming. I've got to do it one at a time rather than simultaneously.
I've realized I'm not *that* committed to OSDev, rather just get something basic. If I can get something to boot, store files &
compile I'll feel like a winner. I need a text editor, some kind of development toolchain, video support and file support.
Which is a lot.... I guess I need to look at MikeOS and Dr. Jacob's ENEE447 course, to learn about it from the RPi perspective.

## What's all this analog computing stuff anyways?
Dealing with op amp non idealities in making a circuit model of a ODE is something I should have covered in pervious circuits classes.
But hey, nobody's perfect. Definitely not me. Never happened, and I never got around to it. Until now that is...

## If it's worth doing once, you can probably repeat it
Doing the same circuit on a BJT, then a MOS on board, then Long Channel and Short channel for a CMOS, then layout, is insanely tedious but hopefully,
brings some elementary insight into the electronics process. At least that's what I hope ya?

Then to do a *math*, if you can call it that, problem once symbolically, then numerically, then in analog circuits. Then in Python, C and finally digital hardware
is definitely not what I call good wholesome family fun.

## So little Jonjon what'd you learn in school today?
Turns out there's a lot of "stuff" I should have learned in class but I never did. Like software development principles.
Ugh...

Hopefully I can do any of these things in a reasonable time. I mean even that is debatable. Who knows. At least it's fun right?

## And now a word from our something or another...
And today's awesome channel is Afrotechmods. By far one of the most humorous EE channels, and gives great explanations too.
