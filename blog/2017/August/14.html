## About those VFDs...
---

I've been looking into those really awesome older display technologies for what seems like forever. I've always wanted to get a Nixie tube clock, or well to design one more than anything. But I think what draws my attention the most are VFD displays. I mean they seem to charge a pretty penny for a newer one, but old tube displays from the many tube stores are fairly cheap. I'd like to build a dB meter and general segmented display using VFD tubes, let's see if I ever get around to it.

## Cheap FPGAs
---

Recently thought of getting a cheaper FPGA setup. I have an Artix 7 from Digilent that allows for breadboard usage, and an Arrow SoCKit which I love, but is grossly overkill for most projects outside of architecture ones. I'd like a simple and cheap setup but with more ALMs or LUTs than what lattice is offering. That and I'm too comfortable with Intel/Altera's setup to really move to something else. Ideally, it being a nonBGA design would be ideal. For price/performance I've found that the Cyclone IV E family to be a good price between $12 for 6k and $35 for 22k. The Cyclone 10 LP is also decent at 25k and much more recent. However the best bang for buck would be the Cyclone V family, where in I can get a consistent ratio of around 700 - 850 LEs/$. The best deal is a 300k LE Cyclone V for <$250, giving you around 1450 LEs/$. The lower priced Cyclone IV are great for one off designs since they are not BGA based. The MAX10 at under $10 with 8k would technically be the best, but it's BGA package kills it's otherwise great specs for one off projects.

Obviously this discounts things like speed grade, DSP slices, embedded memory. I mean this looks purely at it from an LE persepctive. 

## Speaking of FPGAs
---

Ever find yourself looking for a small SOM, but don't want or need a full development board, don't need any fancy appended microprocessors and just want a small SOM? Well as luck would have it there are quite a few retailers but usually the prices are exorbitant. AND THEY NEVER GIVE ANY DRAM. Well usually. 

I found [Trenz Electronics](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TE0713-01-200-2C-FPGA-Module-with-Xilinx-Artix-7-XC7A200T-2FBG484C-4-x-5-cm-1-GByte-DDR3L) & [Numato Labs to be fairly good](https://numato.com/neso-artix-7-fpga-development-board/)

## Wanted...uC + ADC for no money
---

Does that statement ever apply to you? Feel like you want to use a fast ADC but don't feel like shelling out the big bucks or desinging your own system. Just want some COTS setup with very minimal design? Well lucky for your! A very enterprising engineer Henrik has a really cool blog where he details using a 80MSPS(!) ADC integrated with an M4F MCU. The kicker? The whole SoC costs a *whopping* $12! [Link to his blog](http://hforsten.com/cheap-homemade-30-mhz-6-ghz-vector-network-analyzer.html)


## Content Migration

I need to eventually move from my universities email to my work Gmail, but again these random administrative tasks are a pain...
