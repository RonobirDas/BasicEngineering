## Hot Chips retrospective, Back to the future! 
---

I always have a good time browsing through the archives of Hot Chips. The presentations are often more substantiative 
than those from ISSCC depending on how benevolent a particular company was feeling like posting. If you go a ways back to 
1989 during the first HC (my how time flies for those that started since then) there were some crazy predictions and equally crazier chips.
For Pete's sake we had a chip made of GaAs. Sorry a *logic* chip made of GaAs at a whopping 250 MHz. This is in the late 80's! 

Of course that and more trends like the now infamous memory wall are discussed by industry and academic titans such as David Patterson. 
A link to the archive here: [HC20](https://www.hotchips.org/archives/2000s/hc20/), after session 4. A reflection on the [very topic is a good refresher](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5cc3/780286a223c5b27df8e21b20f0c8f538f571.pdf).

## And now to our daily video recommendation
