## Hey! What's the deal with verification, am I right?
---

I'm decently into the verification scene for digital hardware, having experience
with SystemC, SystemVerilog and plain ol' verilog. I'm trying to also nail down
VPI, and more UVM experience, but again lots to do little time. Which brings us
to this [survey](https://blogs.mentor.com/verificationhorizons/blog/2017/01/03/conclusion-the-2016-wilson-research-group-functional-verification-study/)
and these [conclusions](http://agilesoc.com/2017/08/17/39-of-your-verification-budget-goes-to-what/).

A majority of time goes into an ASICs verification stage. I think the old saying was 70 - verification - 30 design of your time budget.
So if you spend 39% of that 70% of time debugging, well you can see why that's an issue. The verification landscape is still experimenting with a million different things
partly because hardware is so difficult to "debug". Even with a system emulation through an FPGA you never do get the entire picture. And that's still the highest level
of accuracy you can achieve in any reasonable amount of time. If you were to do a SPICE based or similar transistor level simulator, no matter how highspeed, for a 100+ million transistor design using current verification strategies to extract the "highest" level of accuracy
we'd all still be using the 8086. It's an unfortuneate scenario really.
