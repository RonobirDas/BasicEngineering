## Device Fundamentals

This is actually an incredibly large field, and I intend to cover all the Engineering Physics topics under this banner. 
My content will be as follows: Video of the topic and Jupyter Notebook of the topic, for those who prefer reading.
I will take notes when necessary transcribed to PDF using a digital paper tablet.   

## References

I have listed some previous references in the following page I wrote a few years back, regarding courses: [Intro to MOS](http://code.ronobirdas.co/mygithubpage/subpage/mosguide.html)

I am more of a book learner than I am a course based learner so this is more for those who prefer a structured course. Please keep this in mind, and that the prior site has not been updated in years.

## Notes

### Introduction to Quantum Mechanics for Electrical Engineers
I'm not even going to pretend to be even somewhat of a remote authority on even intro material. This is QM, you can throw a rock and find well spoken and very accomplished academics who can teach QED to a snail. But we all need to start somewhere, and we, dear reader, start here. 

- Math Foundation
     - Partial Differential Equations
     - Numerical Techniques 
- Fundamentals
     
    Covers Wave - Particle Duality & the Schrodinger Equation
      
- Statistical Mechanics
- Electrons in a Crystal Structure
    Classic Band theory, Periodic Potentials, Kronig - Penney and more!  
- Material Properties
    - Electrical Properties of Materials
    - Optical Properties of Materials
    - Magnetic Properties of Materials
    - Thermal Properties of Materials
